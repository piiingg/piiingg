    <h3>Economist Converting Data into Meaningful Stories </h3>
      <p>I am a big believer in data-driven marketing and I am on a mission to
         make myself a better coder by building a web page that can give
         personalize clothing recommendations for the user according to the
         current weather conditions.</p> <br>

         <p> With that goal in mind, I have taught myself HTML and
           am now learning CSS.</p> <br>
